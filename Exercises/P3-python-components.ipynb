    "Congruence and divisors are important in _modulo groups_, which are mathematical objects with a finite number of values that 'wrap around'. A typical example is a signed 8-bit number, that can represent values from -128 to 127. After 127 it _wraps_ to -128 and continues counting upwards. In mathematics: $127+1 \\equiv -128 \\mod 128$, which reads '127 plus 1 is congruent to -128 modulo 128'. This means that both 128/128 and -128/128 should have the same remainder-- 0 in this case, which is said '128 and -128 are congruent to 0 modulo 128'. Note that the sign-bit takes one place, so the modulo is $2^7 =128$ for an 8-bit number. In this view there are two zeros! The normal 0 and -128 (which is congruent to zero). The 'negative zero' is the last number of the previous iteration in the wrapping cycle as we continue to count upwards. The difference between 0 (binary 00000000) and -128 (binary 10000000) is the sign bit. The numbers we use in computers aren't proper numbers, they have many strange behaviours.\n",

    "a) Implement a class that represents a multiplicative group modulo some number p that is given to the objects constructor. Only implement multiplication for now! Remember to check if the numbers have the same $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Implement a method that checks if two instances of the class are congruent by using the '==' syntax, ie <code> a == b </code> should return true only if a is congruent to b under the same modulus. For example <br/><pre> \n",
    "a = ModGroup(1, 128)\n",
    "b = ModGroup(-127, 128)\n",
    "a == b # true\n",

    "Decide what to do if the instances don't have the same $p$. Should you give an error, return false or can you think of a way to compare numbers from different groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Implement addition, subtraction and, if you can figure out how, division for your class. Remember, the numbers are all integers and division is multiplication with a number's _multiplicative inverse_. For real numbers it's $\\frac{1}{r} * r = 1$, but what would it be here? Ie, is there a number $x_i$ such that $x_ix = 1$? <em>Hint: read up on divisors and greatest common denominator.</em> <br/><br/>\n",
    "With those operations it's no longer a multiplicative group, but a Ring. In fact, if $p$ is prime, then it's a mathematical Field, a very \"normal\" mathematical structure. However, division becomes _very strange_ if $p$ is not prime. Try it out! If you want a taste of some abstract algebra, try to prove when division is well-defined and when it isn't. If you found a multiplicative inverse, you're halfway there already!\n",
