(*) the Central Limit Theorem is a very important proof, but not a requirement for the course.

#### Book
> Milton/Arnold: Chapter 3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 5, 6

##### Exercises:

Exercises with + are more difficult and ++ are challenging; but these also teach something mathematically relevant for advanced students. 
> Exercises: 3.7, 3.10, 3.13, 3.24, 3.41, 3.42, 3.51+, 3.52+ ; 4.5, 4.41+, 4.43 ;  5.3, 5.5, 5.10, 5.12++, 5.35+, 5.36, 5.39, 5.41, 5.42, 5.43

Chapter 6 is a [python exercise](../Exercises/python-descriptive-stats.ipynb)

You aren't expected to complete _all_ exercises. Do as many as you feel you need to grasp the concepts and formulas. Exact calculations by hand aren't super important for machine learning-- the _machine_ will obviously be doing the calculations!
