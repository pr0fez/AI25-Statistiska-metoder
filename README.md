This course introduces statistical methods and concepts needed for _statistical machine learning_, also known nowadays as 'traditional' machine learning.

The course focuses on EDA and _inference_, while foregoing most of use cases for quality control, opinion polling or product trials (e.g. medicine, foodstuffs) other than as examples and mechanical algebra/arithmetic exercises. 

The primary topics are:

    - Probability and likelihood
    - Statistical confidence
    - Statistical linearization
    - Regression methods for inference and classification
    - Exploratory Data Analysis for machine learning
